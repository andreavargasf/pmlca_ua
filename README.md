# ua_pmlca

This repository contains materials for uncertainty analysis (UA) in pavement management life cycle assessment (PMLCA) using open-access software and tools, specifically OpenLCA (OLCA) and Brightway 2.5 (BW25).

## Notebooks for Brightway 2.5 (BW25)

In the [notebooks](notebooks) folder, you will find a collection of Jupyter notebooks that serve as guides for conducting UA in PMLCA using BW25.

## .py Files for OpenLCA (OLCA)

Similarly, in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder, you will find Python (.py) files that provide instructions for performing UA in PMLCA using OLCA.
