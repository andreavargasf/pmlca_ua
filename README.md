# ua_pmlca
This is the repository for uncertainty analysisis (ua) in pavement management life cycle assessment (pmlca) using open access software and tools, namely OpenLCA (OLCA) and Brightway 2.5 (BW25).
For BW25, we provide a number of notebooks - found in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder - to guide you through the assessment.
For OLCA, we provide .py files - also found in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder - that guide you through the assessment. 
For further reading on the case studies in which these materials are based, refer to [Towards Sustainable Pavement Management - A Stochastic LCA Framework for Maintenance and Rehabilitation](https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/towards-sustainable-pavement-management-a-stochastic-lca-framewor)
